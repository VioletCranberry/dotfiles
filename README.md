# 🚀 Dotfiles

This repository houses my personal dotfiles, designed for MacOS with
auto-appearance mode enabled. All configurations are tailored to adapt
seamlessly to appearance changes. The color theming is based on the
following 🎨 [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) palettes:

1. System Dark Mode: Catppuccin Frappé 🪴
2. System Light Mode: Catppuccin Latte 🌻
