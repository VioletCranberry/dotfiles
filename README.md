# 🚀 Dotfiles

This repository houses my personal dotfiles, designed for MacOS with
auto-appearance mode enabled. All configurations are tailored to adapt
seamlessly to appearance changes. The color theming is based on the
following 🎨 [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) palettes:

1. System Dark Mode: Catppuccin Frappé 🪴
2. System Light Mode: Catppuccin Latte 🌻

## 🛠️ Installation

To set up these dotfiles, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VioletCranberry/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
./00_misc.sh
./01_terminal.sh
./02_neovim.sh
# Continue with the remaining scripts 🚀
```
